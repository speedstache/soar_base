                        types have the same privileges within our club, but are targeted towards different demographics.</p>

                      <p><%= Membership.find(3).membership_type %> memberships are targeted towards members age 55 and up. A significant portion of these members are returning to flying after years focused on work and family. They bring with them
                      a lot of life experience and the stories that come with it. </p>

                      <p>Membership in the Eagleville Soaring Club also includes membership in the Soaring Society of America. The SSA was formed in 1932 to foster and promote all phases of soaring, both nationally and internationally. 
                      The SSA publishes a monthly magazing, Soaring, that each Eagleville members receives at their mailing address.</p>
                      <p>Several of our members have been recognized in Soaring magazine either as participants in regional soaring contests, or in recognition of
                      flying achievements such as completion of a Bronze, Silver, or Gold badge flight. </p>

                      <p>Eagleville Soaring Club members with active memberships can reserve time in any of our club gliders in which they possess adequate privileges. Pre-solo student pilot members (Full, Senior, and Student members) 
                      are granted reservation privileges in both of our ASK-21 two place gliders. Student and certificated pilots that have passed solo sign-off can also be granted
                      privileges in our single place ASK-23 glider.  </p>
                      <p>Members are also able to take advantage of our experienced group of glider instructors for training.</p> 
                      <p>Both glider training and usage of the club glider fleet are provided to members at no additional charge. Most members only pay their dues and tow fees, calculated based on how high they towed.
                      Some members who own their own gliders also pay storage fees for keeping their glider in the club hangar through the year. </p>
